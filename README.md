# two-watertanks-one-pump
I have two underground tanks, each filled separately by a single underground pump. Since one tank then pumps water up to the first floor tenant's overhead tank, the pump is operated on a different power line based on what underground tank that's being filled. This is my horrible attempt at automating the whole thing.
